## In this Episode

On this episode we're joined by Anthony Main, founder of ⁠The Distance⁠, a top 5 mobile app development agency in York.

Anthony talks to us about his journey into tech from a CS degree to running a successful development agency for over 15 years!

We chat about changes in technology and business over that 15 years, how remote work is here to stay and why businesses need to adapt, as well as the importance of fostering a solid culture.

We also get some valuable advice from an agency owner on how someone can get started in a career in app development and what makes good job applications stand out.
