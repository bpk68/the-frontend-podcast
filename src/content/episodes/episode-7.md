## In this Episode

A whole seven episodes in and this time, we're talking with [Ben Furfie](https://twitter.com/frontendben) about his background in games journalism that led into a career in web dev. We're also digging into the state of CSS, specifically Tailwind CSS and how a shift towards utility-driven styling can improve code maintainability and how it compares to methodologies such as BEM.
