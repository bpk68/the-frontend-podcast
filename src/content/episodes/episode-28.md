## In this Episode

Joe has been a developer for over 12 years, currently working as a senior engineer at KFC (sadly no free chicken available!).

He started out in his 20's from a recommended web design course. From there he's moved from financial start ups and a leading ticketing company, to AND Digital working as a software engineering consultant.

Joseph's been all-in with FE from the beginning working through jQuery, to Angular JS, to React and Next.js, and trying out things like Astro and Svelte.

In this episode, he and I talk about Joseph's love of CSS, his embracing of modern frameworks and libraries, such as Astro and Next. We also discuss the possibility of React being put out to pasture and has React had its heyday?
