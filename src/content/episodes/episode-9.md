## In this Episode

In this ninth episode I thought I'd do something a little different and host a solo talk where I answer your most frequently asked questions. I'll be answering golden questions such as:

-   How do I get into front end development?
-   Is HTML a programming language?
-   How can I improve my design and CSS skills?
-   What do I think about the term front end development in 2020?
-   What skills should front end developers have?
-   and many more!
